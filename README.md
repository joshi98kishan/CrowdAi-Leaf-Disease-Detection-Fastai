# CrowdAi-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Fastai
Achieved 99% Accuracy on test set.

Used fastai.vision library for training a Convolutional Neural Network on 
'PlantVillage Disease Classification' dataset which was used in the competition on [Crowdai](https://www.crowdai.org).

Dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rashedoz/crowdai-plant-disease-dataset) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

And code is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iWjBWOgbC0XMwYd2XQo6udffB3-IJsL_) on [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).

I have mount the colaboratory with google drive and
used [kaggle-api](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) to directly download the dataset to google drive without
even using our local machine.
